## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to take ride sharing data from V. Isualize in Rural, Urban, and Suburban areas for differences based on the city type.  Analysis and visualization of the data showed that Urban cities generate the most Total Fares while the Rural cities had the highest averages per ride and driver.
## Results
  - Totals Analysis:
    - city_data.csv and ride_data.csv were merged on the city value with a left megrge to combine the datasets.  Total were calculated by grouping the data by city "type".  "total_drivers" were calculated using the sum of "driver_counts", "total_rides" were calculated by using a count on "ride_id", and "total_fares" were calculated by the sum of eacg "fare".  The averages were then calculated for each city type by fare and driver.  Data is presented in a dataframe by each of the calculations.  A line chart of the data for the Total Fare by City Type and is presented as the total fares by week between January 2019 to the end of April 2019.
    - Urban cities represented the largest amounts for total of all categories; Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares.  Suburban cities were the seconds largest in each of the categories while Rural cities made up the smallest values for each of the Total categories.  The Urban Cities by far made up the largest amount of Total Fares by Generating $39,854.38.  This was twice as much as the Suburban Cities and almost ten times the amount generated from Rural Cities.  Totals were highest each month for the Urban cities as seen in the line chart "Total Fare by City Type".  The lowest Total Fares occurred at the very beginning of January while the largest total were seen at the end of February.  
  - Averages Analysis:
    -   The averages were all the highest for the Rural Cities.  Rural Cities averaged $55.49 per driver and $34.53 per ride.  The average fare per driver in Urban Cities was $16.57 and $24.53 per ride.  Suburban averages were in the middle of these two.

 ## Summary
 The data presented shows that Urban Cities are the generate the highest Fares by far of any of the other city types.  The following recommendations are based upon the data and visualations presented in the analysis.  One recommendation would be to increase the Total Drivers in Rural Cities.  There were 125 rides and only 78 drivers.  The demand for rides may be much higher in this area and there are not enough drivers to meet the demand.  The ratio of rides to drivers is much lower than in both the Urban and Suburban areas which may represent a disparity that needs to be addressed.  Another recommendation that goes along with that would be to increase marketing in Urban areas.  Although it generated the most Total Fares, there were more drivers than total rides.  Increasing marketing and awareness could increase the Total Rides in Urban areas and continue make a strength of V. Isualize even stronger.  A final recommendation would be to institute surge pricing in Urban Cities, this would increase the average fare per driver and average fare per ride.
